Hello! Dear Viewer, 

this wiki is made to demonstrate Quartz to Luiis, and how i would use it properly (its free and self hosted) have a look [here](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages) if you are interested in how i did this! :)


Update: 28.01.2024
- Started the website, lets go!!
- Going to make MyMDT here, as an example


this website is also probably where the new coming discord bot is going to go!

this website is written in english, because there is going to be 2 websites when this is done! :)
